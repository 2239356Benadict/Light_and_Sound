# Light_and_Sound
 Lighting & Sound for the VR MSc for Swansea University
### Description
<p align="justify">
The application is a simple interactable environment which users can walk around and explore. Most of the lights used are baked and some are in real-time. There are three real-time lights which can turn on with controller interaction. Two-floor lamps can be turned on by selecting the switch on the pillar. Another real-time light is used for the torch which can be used for finding the switches. For doing the action point the controller line renderer to the exact game object and presses the grip button floor lamps and trigger button for the torch. Apart from these, once the player walks towards and stands very close to the avatars interactive foley sounds will be played.

### Additional Feature 1: Torch and Switch
<p align="justify">
There are real-time lights which can be turned on by controller interaction. Since it is an event happening inside a hall, dim lights are used. Hence a Torch has been included, which can be used to find the floor lamp switches. The Torchlight can be enabled by grabbing and pressing the trigger button of the controller. The switches for the Floor lamps are placed on the pillars and the light will turn on after pointing the controller to the switch and by pressing the grip button. For both Torch and Floor Lamp, point lights are used.   

### Additional Feature 2: Interactable Avatars
<p align="justify">
In a VR environment, the user should be able to interact with the characters in the environment. Considering that interactive characters are included in this project. Once the user stands to a certain distance the foley sound will be played. There are a few sounds added which will be played randomly. The concept is to make the user aware that he/she enters the personal space of others.
