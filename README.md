# Light_and_Sound
 Lighting & Sound for the VR MSc for Swansea University
### Description

The application is a simple interactable environment which users can walk around and explore. Most of the lights used are baked and some are in real-time. There are three real-time lights which can turn on with controller interaction. Two-floor lamps can be turned on by selecting the switch on the pillar. Another real-time light is used for the torch which can be used for finding the switches. For doing the action point the controller line renderer to the exact game object and presses the grip button floor lamps and trigger button for the torch. Apart from these, once the player walks towards and stands very close to the avatars interactive foley sounds will be played.

A log with fire will be present on the scene, which can be used to light the wood log. The user has to grab the wood log with fire as usual using the controller grip.
